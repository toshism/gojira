* GOJira

** Overview
   Import a jira issue into org-mode as a todo.

   Gojira is built on top of org-jira and acts as a simpler alternative interface
   for using org-jira. It allows you to use an existing org file and import
   issues as single standalone entities.

   It's currently only one way. Jira->Org. I may someday add the other
   direction.

   Depends on org-jira here https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira

** Usage
   Install org-jira from https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira

   Set your jira url
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq jiralib-url "https://jira.example.com")
   #+END_SRC

   To pull an issue from jira into your org file call
   =gojira-insert-issue-as-org=. You will be prompted for the jira issue key.

   It's easiest to map that to a keybinding.

   Example of loading and binding. (uses use-package)
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (use-package gojira
       :load-path "~/elisp/gojira/"
       :bind (("C-c j" . gojira-insert-issue-as-org)))
   #+END_SRC
